**Machine Learning-Based Energy Consumption Forecasting in Smart Grids**

This project focuses on predicting energy consumption in smart grid environments using Machine Learning techniques.
The goal is to build accurate regression models that can forecast total energy usage based on environmental and temporal features such as temperature, humidity, date, time, weekend, and holidays.

Accurate forecasting helps in:

Load balancing

Energy optimization

Renewable energy integration

Cost reduction

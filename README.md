# Energy-Consumption
Machine Learning-Based Energy Consumption Forecasting in Smart Grids
• Developed a machine learning-based energy consumption forecasting system for smart grid environments.

• Performed data preprocessing including missing value handling, outlier treatment (Winsorization), feature scaling, and label encoding.

• Implemented feature selection using SelectKBest (ANOVA F-test) to improve model performance.

• Built and compared regression models including Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Random Forest Regressor.

• Evaluated models using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.

• Achieved R² score of 93% using Random Forest Regressor, significantly outperforming SVM (58%).

• Automated model saving and loading using Joblib for deployment readiness.

• Designed visualization dashboards using Matplotlib and Seaborn for regression analysis.
